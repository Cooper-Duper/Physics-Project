My final project for AP Physics. It's not in anything nearing a completed state
yet frankly (at least how I envisioned it), but it's almost good enough ish...

This repo's mainly public so that the class could look at the source code (and
anyone interested could download and compile it), not because I'm especially
proud of it in its current state.
