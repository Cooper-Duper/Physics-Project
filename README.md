My final project for AP Physics, built using [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib?tab=readme-ov-file). It's not in anything nearing a completed state yet frankly (at least how I envisioned it), but it's almost good enough ish...

This repo's mainly public so that the class could look at the source code (andanyone interested could download and compile it), not because I'm especiallyproud of it in its current state.

P.S.
I don't really know how licenses work, so while I don't expect anyone to, please don't take drastic action... If I somehow managed to violate the Raylib license, just let me know and I'll fix it. I just haven't had the time to look into that yet.
